# Process Pull Request Comments

## Purpose
This workflow processes analyzed pull request comments from `./tmp/PR_CONVERSATIONS.md` and executes actions based on the Decision field for each relevant comment.

## Process

### 1. Read Analysis File
- Load `./tmp/PR_CONVERSATIONS.md` 
- Parse all comments

### 2. Process Each Conversation
1. if Status is OUTDATED, mark it as resolved 
2. if Decision is IGNORE or Empty on you can't recognise what to do then go to next item
3. if Decision is RESOLVE then just mark it as resolved  
4. if Decision is PROCESS or FIX, then process it carefully, using common rules and then mark it as resolved
5. if Decision is Create Issue , fix later, then create issue on github, add link and full description of this comment and mark it as resolved

## Notes
- If Id: Local then no need to resolve conversation, it's made by local tool
- To mark conversation resolved use command `npx tsx scripts/resolve-pr-conversation.ts COVERSTION_ID Comments`
- Use comment provided in Decision, rephrase it to fix English, but keep wording. If conversation was processed and fixed, than create 7-15 words comment what ws made exactly.
