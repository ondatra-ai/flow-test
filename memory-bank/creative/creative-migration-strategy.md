# CREATIVE PHASE: MIGRATION STRATEGY

## Problem Statement

Design a comprehensive migration strategy to safely move 22 type/interface definitions to src/types/ and replace 57 unknown usages while maintaining backward compatibility and minimizing disruption.

## Decision Summary

**Chosen Approach:** Automated Incremental Migration with Validation

### Migration Timeline

- **Day 1**: Preparation and Infrastructure Setup
- **Days 2-3**: Automated Type Migration
- **Days 3-4**: Unknown Usage Migration
- **Day 5**: Cleanup and Validation

### Key Components

#### Migration Scripts

1. **analyze-types.ts** - Find all type/interface declarations
2. **analyze-unknown.ts** - Find all unknown usage patterns
3. **migrate-types.ts** - Move types with dependency ordering
4. **migrate-unknown.ts** - Replace unknown with handlers
5. **update-imports.ts** - Automatically update import paths
6. **verify-migration.ts** - Validate migration success
7. **rollback.ts** - Emergency rollback procedures

#### Migration Order

Based on dependency analysis:

1. Configuration types (no dependencies)
2. Utility types (minimal dependencies)
3. Provider interfaces
4. Flow system types (complex dependencies)
5. Validation types

#### Safety Measures

- Backup branch before starting
- Re-exports maintain compatibility
- Incremental commits for partial rollback
- Test validation after each step
- ESLint rules as warnings initially

### Technical Approach

- Use ts-morph for AST manipulation
- Dependency graph for migration ordering
- Automated import path updates
- Pattern matching for unknown replacement
- Git automation for commits

### Rollback Strategy

- **Critical Issues**: Full git revert to backup
- **Major Issues**: Revert specific commits
- **Minor Issues**: Fix forward with patches

### Success Metrics

- All 22 types successfully migrated
- All 57 unknown instances replaced
- All imports updated (estimated 150+)
- All tests passing
- Build successful
- ESLint rules enabled

## Benefits

1. **Automated** - Reduces human error
2. **Incremental** - Each step validated
3. **Traceable** - Clear migration log
4. **Reversible** - Multiple rollback options
5. **Reproducible** - Scripts can be reused
