# CREATIVE PHASES SUMMARY

## Task: Centralize Type System and Unknown Type Handling

### Creative Phases Completed

#### 1. Type Organization Architecture ✅

**Decision**: Domain-Based Nested Structure

- Organized by domain (flow, providers, github, config, validation, utils)
- Maximum 2 levels of nesting
- Barrel exports for clean imports
- Special handling for unknown-handler.ts

#### 2. Unknown Handler Architecture ✅

**Decision**: Flat Static Methods with Individual Exports

- Single UnknownHandler class with static methods
- Grouped into: Type Guards, Converters, Validators, Utilities
- Dual API supporting both class and function imports
- Zero runtime overhead for type guards

#### 3. Cast Function Algorithm ✅

**Decision**: Registry-Based Validation with Type Guards

- Clean cast<T,X>(x:X):T signature with overloads
- Registry-based type guards, inline validators, schema support
- Fast registry lookups (~5μs) with lazy validation
- Clear, specific error messages

#### 4. ESLint Rules Design ✅

**Decision**: Layered Configuration Using no-restricted-syntax

- Built-in ESLint rules only (no custom plugin)
- AST selectors for type detection
- File-based overrides for src/types/
- Migration support with warnings

#### 5. Migration Strategy ✅

**Decision**: Automated Incremental Migration

- Custom scripts using ts-morph
- Dependency-aware migration ordering
- Automated import updates
- Incremental validation at each step
- 5-day migration timeline

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Type Location**: All types must reside in `src/types/` organized by domain
2. **Unknown Handling**: Only `unknown-handler.ts` may use the `unknown` keyword
3. **Import Strategy**: Use path aliases (@/types) for clean imports
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Temporary re-exports during migration
5. **Validation Approach**: Progressive enhancement from simple to complex

## Implementation Readiness

All creative design work is complete. The project now has:

- Clear architectural vision
- Detailed implementation patterns
- Comprehensive migration plan
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Success criteria defined

Ready to proceed to IMPLEMENT mode.
