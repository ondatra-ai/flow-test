# CREATIVE PHASES SUMMARY

## Task: Centralize Type System with ESLint-First Migration

### Creative Phases Completed

#### 1. Type and Interface Organization Architecture ✅

**Decision**: Separated Folders with Domain-Based Structure

- Types organized in `src/types/` by domain
- Interfaces organized in `src/interfaces/` by domain
- Maximum 2 levels of nesting
- Barrel exports for clean imports

#### 2. ESLint Rules Design ✅

**Decision**: Configuration Using no-restricted-syntax with Three Rules

- Built-in ESLint rules only (no custom plugin)
- AST selectors for type, interface, and unknown detection
- Different messages for types vs interfaces vs unknown
- File-based overrides for src/types/, src/interfaces/, and src/utils/cast.ts
- Clear, actionable error messages

#### 3. Cast Function Design ✅

**Decision**: Simple Type Assertion Helper

- Minimal API with cast<T> function
- Optional safeCast with validation
- Common type guards included
- Only file allowed to use unknown keyword
- Located at src/utils/cast.ts

#### 4. Migration Strategy ✅

**Decision**: ESLint-First Migration Approach

- Start by implementing ESLint rules
- Use violations as a task list
- Fix violations systematically
- Create infrastructure only as needed
- Validate progress through ESLint

## Key Implementation Decision

**ESLint-First Approach**: Rather than creating infrastructure upfront, implement ESLint rules first to identify all violations, then fix them systematically. This provides:

- Clear visibility of all issues
- Guided migration process
- Built-in validation
- Progress tracking
- No wasted effort

## Implementation Readiness

All creative design work is complete. The implementation approach is:

1. Add ESLint rules to .eslintrc.json
2. Run lint to see all violations
3. Fix each violation systematically
4. Validate with ESLint after each fix
5. Complete when zero violations remain

Ready to proceed to IMPLEMENT mode with ESLint-first approach.
