# CREATIVE PHASES SUMMARY

## Task: Centralize Type System with Type/Interface Separation and Cast Utilities

### Creative Phases Completed

#### 1. Type and Interface Organization Architecture ✅

**Decision**: Separated Folders with Domain-Based Structure

- Types organized in `src/types/` by domain
- Interfaces organized in `src/interfaces/` by domain
- Maximum 2 levels of nesting
- Barrel exports for clean imports

#### 2. ESLint Rules Design ✅

**Decision**: Configuration Using no-restricted-syntax with Three Rules

- Built-in ESLint rules only (no custom plugin)
- AST selectors for type, interface, and unknown detection
- Different messages for types vs interfaces vs unknown
- File-based overrides for src/types/, src/interfaces/, and src/utils/cast.ts
- Migration support with warnings

#### 3. Cast Function Design ✅

**Decision**: Simple Type Assertion Helper

- Minimal API with cast<T> function
- Optional safeCast with validation
- Common type guards included
- Only file allowed to use unknown keyword
- Located at src/utils/cast.ts

#### 4. Migration Strategy ✅

**Decision**: Automated Incremental Migration

- Separate scripts for types, interfaces, and unknown
- Dependency-aware migration ordering
- Automated import updates
- Incremental validation at each step
- 5-day migration timeline

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Type Location**: All types must reside in `src/types/` organized by domain
2. **Interface Location**: All interfaces must reside in `src/interfaces/` organized by domain
3. **Unknown Handling**: Only `src/utils/cast.ts` may use the `unknown` keyword
4. **Import Strategy**: Use path aliases (@/types, @/interfaces, @/utils/cast) for clean imports
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Temporary re-exports during migration
6. **Test Exception**: Test files can define local types, interfaces, and use unknown

## Implementation Readiness

All creative design work is complete. The project now has:

- Clear architectural vision with type/interface separation
- Centralized unknown handling through cast.ts
- Detailed implementation patterns
- Comprehensive migration plan
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Success criteria defined

Ready to proceed to IMPLEMENT mode.
