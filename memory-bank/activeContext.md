- **Tests Added**: 14 new tests
- **Total Tests**: 62 (all passing)
- **Dependencies Added**: 3 SDKs
- **Code Quality**: Strict TypeScript, ESLint compliant

## Next Mode: REFLECT

Ready to transition to REFLECT mode to:

- Document lessons learned
- Analyze architectural decisions
- Prepare comprehensive archive
- Identify future improvements

## Task Requirements Summary

### Core Components

- **Unified LLM Interface**: ILLMService with standardized API
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Grok integrations
- **Phase-Specific Capabilities**: Planning, Creative, Implementation, QA phases
- **Configuration Management**: API keys, model selection, rate limiting

### Architecture Scope

- `src/services/llm/` - New LLM services directory
- Provider implementations for 4 major LLM services
- Type system for requests/responses
- Configuration and security management
- Integration with existing Flow system

## Previous Completed Tasks

✅ **Context Interface Implementation** (Level 2) - COMPLETED & ARCHIVED on 2025-01-07
✅ **Flow System Session Implementation** (Level 3) - COMPLETED & ARCHIVED on 2025-01-07
✅ **Project Cleanup - Preserve Tests:Generate Command** (Level 3) - COMPLETED & ARCHIVED on 2025-01-06
✅ **Node.js 22 Upgrade** (Level 1) - COMPLETED & ARCHIVED on 2025-01-06

## Established Standards

- ✅ Comprehensive QA process (test, lint, type-check, format)
- ✅ Memory Bank workflows optimized
- ✅ Interface-based architecture patterns established
- ✅ Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 task templates proven
- ✅ Test-driven development approach validated
- ✅ Context integration pattern established
- ✅ Coverage requirements documented (90% for standard code)
- ✅ String storage standards for flow data sharing

## Development Patterns Established

- **Simplicity-First Design**: Start minimal, add complexity only when needed
- **Interface-Based Architecture**: Use interfaces for dependencies to improve testability
- **Iterative Refinement**: Small, testable iterations enable confident refactoring
- **Quality Gates**: Continuous testing prevents technical debt
- **Context Pattern**: String-string storage for data sharing during flow execution
- **Type-First Development**: Define concrete types before implementation
- **Coverage Standards**: 90% threshold for internal code, exemptions for external integrations

## VAN Mode Verification Results

- **Test Status**: ✅ All 48 tests passing
- **TypeScript**: ✅ No compilation errors
- **Services Directory**: ❌ Not present (clean slate for new implementation)
- **Flow System**: ✅ Ready for integration
- **Complexity**: ✅ Level 4 Complex System confirmed

## Next Steps

- **Immediate**: Execute PLAN mode for comprehensive architectural planning
- **Research Phase**: Investigate SDK capabilities and integration patterns
- **Design Phase**: Create unified interface and type system
- **Implementation**: Phased approach with provider-by-provider implementation

## Task Transition

**From**: VAN Mode (Verification Complete)
**To**: PLAN Mode (Architectural Planning)
**Status**: Ready for transition

## Architecture Foundation

The existing Flow system with Context provides a solid foundation for LLM service integration:

- Context system for data sharing between AI operations
- Session management for stateful interactions
- Step-based execution for complex workflows
- Type-safe interfaces for reliable integration

## Recent Achievements

- **Context Interface**: Clean string-string storage with full type safety
- **Flow Integration**: Seamless Session → Flow → Step Context passing
- **Quality Excellence**: 100% test coverage for new code
- **Architecture Foundation**: Context pattern established for future development
- **Standards Documentation**: Coverage requirements and Context patterns documented
