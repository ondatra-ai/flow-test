# ACTIVE CONTEXT

## Current Mode: VAN MODE - COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT COMPLETE

## Current Task: eslint-interface-naming-20250203

**GitHub Issue**: #84 - Add ESLint rule to enforce interface naming convention (I prefix)
**Branch**: task-20250203-eslint-interface-naming
**Complexity**: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement

## Task Summary

Adding ESLint rule to enforce consistent interface naming convention where all interfaces must start with the 'I' prefix. This involves:

1. Configuring @typescript-eslint/naming-convention rule
2. Updating all existing interfaces to follow the convention
3. Updating all imports and references
4. Ensuring tests pass after changes

## Critical Mode Transition Required

⚠️ **FORCE MODE SWITCH TRIGGERED**

This is a Level 2 task that requires proper planning and documentation.
VAN mode is designed for Level 1 quick fixes only.

**Next Required Action**: Type 'PLAN' to switch to planning mode

## Context from Previous Task

The Memory Bank has been fully optimized from the previous task (improve-test-mock-validation-20250201), which established:

- Type-safe testing infrastructure
- Architecture improvement patterns
- Systematic quality procedures

These capabilities will support the current interface naming standardization effort.

## Technical Context

- Framework: TypeScript project with ESLint already configured
- Testing: Vitest with comprehensive test coverage requirements
- Code Quality: Strict TypeScript settings with all strict flags enabled
- Current State: Mixed interface naming patterns requiring standardization
