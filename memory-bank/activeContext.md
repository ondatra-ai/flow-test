# ACTIVE CONTEXT: Ready for Next Task

## Current Status

Memory Bank is ready for the next task assignment.

## Last Completed Task

✅ **Context Interface Implementation** (Level 2) - COMPLETED & ARCHIVED on 2025-01-07

- Archive: `memory-bank/archive/context-interface-archive-20250707.md`
- Reflection: `memory-bank/reflection/context-interface-reflection.md`
- Result: String-string Context interface with seamless Flow system integration, 48 tests, 100% coverage

## Previous Completed Tasks

✅ **Flow System Session Implementation** (Level 3) - COMPLETED & ARCHIVED on 2025-01-07
✅ **Project Cleanup - Preserve Tests:Generate Command** (Level 3) - COMPLETED & ARCHIVED on 2025-01-06
✅ **Node.js 22 Upgrade** (Level 1) - COMPLETED & ARCHIVED on 2025-01-06

## Established Standards

- ✅ Comprehensive QA process (test, lint, type-check, format)
- ✅ Memory Bank workflows optimized
- ✅ Interface-based architecture patterns established
- ✅ Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 task templates proven
- ✅ Test-driven development approach validated
- ✅ Context integration pattern established
- ✅ Coverage requirements documented (90% for standard code)
- ✅ String storage standards for flow data sharing

## Development Patterns Established

- **Simplicity-First Design**: Start minimal, add complexity only when needed
- **Interface-Based Architecture**: Use interfaces for dependencies to improve testability
- **Iterative Refinement**: Small, testable iterations enable confident refactoring
- **Quality Gates**: Continuous testing prevents technical debt
- **Context Pattern**: String-string storage for data sharing during flow execution
- **Type-First Development**: Define concrete types before implementation
- **Coverage Standards**: 90% threshold for internal code, exemptions for external integrations

## Next Steps

- Memory Bank is prepared for new task assignment
- All established QA standards will be applied to future work
- Context interface patterns ready for reuse in complex flow scenarios
- Use VAN MODE to initialize the next task

## Context Reset

The active context has been reset and is ready for the next development task.

## Recent Achievements

- **Context Interface**: Clean string-string storage with full type safety
- **Flow Integration**: Seamless Session → Flow → Step Context passing
- **Quality Excellence**: 100% test coverage for new code
- **Architecture Foundation**: Context pattern established for future development
- **Standards Documentation**: Coverage requirements and Context patterns documented
