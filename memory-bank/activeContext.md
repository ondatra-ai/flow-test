# Memory Bank: Active Context

## Current Focus

Creative phase complete for comprehensive type system centralization (GitHub Issue #76)

## Status

**Mode**: CREATIVE COMPLETE  
**Phase**: All 5 creative phases successfully completed  
**Task**: centralize-type-system-20250712

## Creative Phases Completed

### 1. Type Organization Architecture ✅

- **Decision**: Domain-based nested structure
- **Key Features**: Max 2 levels nesting, barrel exports, organized by domain
- **Document**: memory-bank/creative/creative-type-organization.md

### 2. Unknown Handler Architecture ✅

- **Decision**: Flat static methods with individual exports
- **Key Features**: Type guards, converters, validators, utilities
- **Document**: memory-bank/creative/creative-unknown-handler.md

### 3. Cast Function Algorithm ✅

- **Decision**: Registry-based validation with cast<T,X>(x:X):T
- **Key Features**: Clean API, overloaded signatures, ~5μs registry lookups
- **Document**: memory-bank/creative/creative-cast-algorithm.md

### 4. ESLint Rules Design ✅

- **Decision**: Layered configuration using no-restricted-syntax
- **Key Features**: AST selectors, file overrides, migration support
- **Document**: memory-bank/creative/creative-eslint-rules.md

### 5. Migration Strategy ✅

- **Decision**: Automated incremental migration
- **Key Features**: ts-morph scripts, dependency ordering, 5-day timeline
- **Document**: memory-bank/creative/creative-migration-strategy.md

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. All types must reside in `src/types/` organized by domain
2. Only `unknown-handler.ts` may use the `unknown` keyword
3. Use path aliases (@/types) for clean imports
4. Temporary re-exports for backward compatibility
5. Progressive enhancement for validation complexity

## Implementation Plan Ready

- Phase 1: Type Infrastructure Setup (Day 1)
- Phase 2: Type Migration (Days 2-3)
- Phase 3: Unknown Migration (Days 3-4)
- Phase 4: Cleanup & Validation (Day 5)

## Next Steps

1. Switch to IMPLEMENT mode
2. Begin with Phase 1: Infrastructure setup
3. Create migration scripts
4. Execute automated migration plan

## Context for Next Mode

**Recommended**: IMPLEMENT mode to begin executing the migration plan

- Start with creating src/types/ structure
- Implement UnknownHandler from POC
- Set up ESLint rules as warnings
- Create migration scripts
- Begin incremental migration
