# ACTIVE CONTEXT

## Current Task Status

ðŸŸ§ **PLAN MODE COMPLETE** - Ready for CREATIVE Mode

## Active Task

- **Task**: Improve Test Mock Validation Infrastructure
- **ID**: improve-test-mock-validation-20250201
- **Issue**: #105
- **Type**: Level 4 Complex System
- **Branch**: task-20250201-improve-test-mock-validation
- **Status**: Planning complete, technology validated, creative phases identified

## Planning Achievements

âœ… **Comprehensive Architectural Planning**

- Full requirements analysis (functional & non-functional)
- Component architecture designed
- 4-phase implementation strategy defined
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies documented

âœ… **Technology Validation**

- Proof of concept successfully implemented and tested
- Type-safe mock validation approach validated
- Performance impact minimal
- All 7 POC tests passing

âœ… **Creative Phases Identified**

1. Mock Validation API Design
2. Type System Architecture
3. Migration Strategy Design

## Next Steps

### CREATIVE MODE Required

This Level 4 task has 3 creative phases that need design decisions:

1. **Mock Validation API Design**
   - Design the public API surface
   - Define error handling patterns
   - Create intuitive developer experience

2. **Type System Architecture**
   - Design generic constraints
   - Ensure type safety guarantees
   - Handle edge cases gracefully

3. **Migration Strategy Design**
   - Plan automated migration approach
   - Define batch processing strategy
   - Create rollback mechanisms

**Action Required**: Type 'CREATIVE' to begin the design phase

## Key Implementation Details

- **Affected Files**: All test files with mock call arguments (~4+ identified)
- **New Infrastructure**: `tests/test-utils/mock-validation/` directory
- **Pattern to Replace**: `mock.calls[0][0] as Type` patterns
- **Success Criteria**: Zero unsafe type assertions, < 5% performance overhead
