# Memory Bank: Active Context

## Current Focus

Creative phase complete for comprehensive type system centralization with type/interface separation (GitHub Issue #76)

## Status

**Mode**: CREATIVE COMPLETE  
**Phase**: All 3 creative phases successfully completed  
**Task**: centralize-type-system-20250712

## Creative Phases Completed

### 1. Type and Interface Organization Architecture ✅

- **Decision**: Separated folders with domain-based structure
- **Key Features**: Types in src/types/, interfaces in src/interfaces/, max 2 levels nesting, barrel exports
- **Document**: memory-bank/creative/creative-type-organization.md

### 2. ESLint Rules Design ✅

- **Decision**: Configuration using no-restricted-syntax with separate rules
- **Key Features**: AST selectors, separate rules for types vs interfaces, file overrides, migration support
- **Document**: memory-bank/creative/creative-eslint-rules.md

### 3. Migration Strategy ✅

- **Decision**: Automated incremental migration
- **Key Features**: Separate scripts for types and interfaces, dependency ordering, 4-day timeline
- **Document**: memory-bank/creative/creative-migration-strategy.md

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. All types must reside in `src/types/` organized by domain
2. All interfaces must reside in `src/interfaces/` organized by domain
3. Use path aliases (@/types, @/interfaces) for clean imports
4. Temporary re-exports for backward compatibility
5. Test files can define local types and interfaces

## Implementation Plan Ready

- Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Day 1)
- Phase 2: Type Migration to src/types/ (Day 2)
- Phase 3: Interface Migration to src/interfaces/ (Day 3)
- Phase 4: Cleanup & Validation (Day 4)

## Next Steps

1. Switch to IMPLEMENT mode
2. Begin with Phase 1: Infrastructure setup
3. Create src/interfaces/ directory structure
4. Set up ESLint rules as warnings
5. Execute migration plan

## Context for Next Mode

**Recommended**: IMPLEMENT mode to begin executing the migration plan

- Start with creating src/interfaces/ directory structure
- Set up ESLint rules as warnings
- Create migration scripts
- Begin incremental migration of types and interfaces separately
