## Current Status

**TASK COMPLETED** ✅ - Ready for Next Task

## Recently Completed Task

**Task**: Implement Dynamic Step Execution with Context Mapping  
**Task ID**: dynamic-step-execution-20250710  
**Issue**: GitHub #31  
**Completion Date**: 2025-07-10  
**Type**: Level 2 Simple Enhancement  
**Status**: FULLY COMPLETED & ARCHIVED

### Final Achievement Summary

✅ **Dynamic Step Execution** - Successfully implemented context-driven step navigation  
✅ **Context-Based Routing** - Flows can now make runtime decisions about execution paths  
✅ **Object Mapping Format** - Clean `Record<string, string>` format for routing configuration  
✅ **Quality Standards** - 147 tests passing, 0 TypeScript errors, 0 ESLint warnings  
✅ **End-to-End Verification** - CLI functionality confirmed for both basic and dynamic routing  
✅ **Archive Documentation** - Comprehensive archive created with lessons learned

### Impact on System Architecture

This implementation establishes the foundational dynamic step execution capability required for the automated GitHub task resolution system (EPIC #28). The Flow system can now:

- Make runtime decisions about execution paths based on context values
- Support complex routing scenarios with default fallbacks
- Enable programmatic flow control for automated task processing
- Provide clean interfaces for context-driven automation
