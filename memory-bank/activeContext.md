# ACTIVE CONTEXT

## Current Task: centralize-test-mocks-20250125 ðŸ”„

**Issue**: #99 - Centralize test mocks into shared tests/unit/mocks directory
**Type**: Level 3 - Intermediate Feature (Testing Infrastructure)
**Status**: PLAN Mode Complete - Ready for Implementation
**Date Started**: 2025-01-25
**Branch**: task-20250125-centralize-test-mocks

### Task Summary

This task involves creating a centralized mock management system to eliminate duplication and establish consistent mock patterns across all test files. The implementation requires:

- Creating a structured tests/unit/mocks/ directory
- Developing mock factories for all core interfaces
- Migrating existing test files to use centralized mocks
- Establishing TypeScript-safe mock patterns
- Creating ESLint rule to enforce architectural decisions
- Phased implementation approach to minimize disruption

### ðŸ“‹ Implementation Plan Complete

**Phased Approach Defined**:

1. **Phase 0: ESLint Rule** (1-2 hours)
   - Add custom rule to forbid cast import in test files
   - Identify all current violations
   - Prevent new violations during migration

2. **Phase 1: Mock Infrastructure** (2-3 hours)
   - Create mock directory structure
   - Implement core mock factories
   - Test factories in isolation

3. **Phase 2: High-Impact Migration** (2-3 hours)
   - Start with plan-generation-step tests
   - These have the most duplication
   - Measure code reduction

4. **Phase 3: Complete Migration** (3-4 hours)
   - Migrate all remaining test files
   - Ensure zero cast usage in tests
   - Verify all tests pass

5. **Phase 4: Documentation** (1 hour)
   - Create comprehensive docs
   - Update project guidelines

### Key Design Decisions âœ…

1. **Factory Pattern**: All mocks created via typed factory functions
2. **Preset Behaviors**: Success, error, and custom options
3. **No Cast in Tests**: Cast only used inside mock factories
4. **ESLint Enforcement**: Automatic prevention of anti-patterns

### Challenges Identified

- ESLint custom rule complexity â†’ Use no-restricted-imports if needed
- Breaking tests during migration â†’ One file at a time approach
- Type safety without cast â†’ Factories return fully typed objects
- Large migration scope â†’ Phased approach with verification

### Next Steps

**Action Required**: Begin Implementation

1. Start with Phase 0: ESLint Rule Implementation
2. This will prevent new violations while we migrate
3. Then proceed with mock infrastructure creation

## System State

- **PLAN Mode**: Complete âœ…
- **Implementation Plan**: Detailed and Phased âœ…
- **Design Decisions**: Documented âœ…
- **Challenges**: Identified with Mitigations âœ…
- **Time Estimate**: 8-12 hours total
- **Required Mode**: IMPLEMENT
