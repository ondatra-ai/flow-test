# Memory Bank: Active Context

## Current Focus

Creative phase complete for comprehensive type system centralization with type/interface separation and cast utilities (GitHub Issue #76)

## Status

**Mode**: CREATIVE COMPLETE  
**Phase**: All 4 creative phases successfully completed  
**Task**: centralize-type-system-20250712

## Creative Phases Completed

### 1. Type and Interface Organization Architecture ✅

- **Decision**: Separated folders with domain-based structure
- **Key Features**: Types in src/types/, interfaces in src/interfaces/, max 2 levels nesting, barrel exports
- **Document**: memory-bank/creative/creative-type-organization.md

### 2. ESLint Rules Design ✅

- **Decision**: Configuration using no-restricted-syntax with three separate rules
- **Key Features**: AST selectors for types, interfaces, and unknown; file overrides; migration support
- **Document**: memory-bank/creative/creative-eslint-rules.md

### 3. Cast Function Design ✅

- **Decision**: Simple type assertion helper for centralized unknown handling
- **Key Features**: Minimal API, optional validation, only file allowed to use unknown
- **Document**: memory-bank/creative/creative-cast-design.md

### 4. Migration Strategy ✅

- **Decision**: Automated incremental migration
- **Key Features**: Separate scripts for types, interfaces, and unknown; dependency ordering; 5-day timeline
- **Document**: memory-bank/creative/creative-migration-strategy.md

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. All types must reside in `src/types/` organized by domain
2. All interfaces must reside in `src/interfaces/` organized by domain
3. Only `src/utils/cast.ts` may use the `unknown` keyword
4. Use path aliases (@/types, @/interfaces, @/utils/cast) for clean imports
5. Temporary re-exports for backward compatibility
6. Test files can define local types, interfaces, and use unknown

## Implementation Plan Ready

- Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Day 1)
- Phase 2: Type Migration to src/types/ (Day 2)
- Phase 3: Interface Migration to src/interfaces/ (Day 3)
- Phase 4: Unknown Usage Migration (Day 4)
- Phase 5: Cleanup & Validation (Day 5)

## Next Steps

1. Switch to IMPLEMENT mode
2. Begin with Phase 1: Infrastructure setup
3. Create src/interfaces/ directory structure
4. Create src/utils/cast.ts with utilities
5. Set up ESLint rules as warnings
6. Execute migration plan

## Context for Next Mode

**Recommended**: IMPLEMENT mode to begin executing the migration plan

- Start with creating src/interfaces/ directory structure
- Create src/utils/cast.ts with simple cast utilities
- Set up ESLint rules as warnings with all three restrictions
- Create migration scripts
- Begin incremental migration of types, interfaces, and unknown usage
