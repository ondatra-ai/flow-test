## Next Task Planning

**Status**: Awaiting task assignment
**Recommended Mode**: VAN (Initialization) mode for next task analysis

## Current System State

- âœ… Codebase clean with GitHub Plan Generation Step successfully integrated
- âœ… All tests passing (198/198) with zero quality issues
- âœ… LLM integration architecture established and proven
- âœ… Schema-first design patterns documented and ready for reuse
- âœ… Memory Bank updated with comprehensive documentation and lessons learned
- âœ… Ready for Epic #28 development or other task assignments

## Available Enhancement Opportunities

- Epic #28: GitHub Task Automation Flow (foundation now complete)
- Additional LLM provider integrations (OpenAI, Gemini)
- Enhanced template engine for complex use cases
- Context enrichment with additional GitHub data
- Output format options (JSON, XML, structured text)

## Key Insights Available

- TDD with real external APIs provides superior confidence
- Schema-first design with Zod validation creates bulletproof type safety
- Template variable substitution patterns for GitHub integration
- Quality gate enforcement prevents technical debt accumulation
- Level 2 enhancement execution methodology refined and proven

## Follow-up Tasks Created

### Immediate Opportunities

- **Issue #96**: GitHub Plan Posting Step (Level 2, 6-9 hours)
  - Complete the automation flow by posting generated plans back to GitHub
  - Builds directly on completed Plan Generation Step foundation
  - Ready for immediate implementation

- **Issue #97**: Enhanced Project Context Analysis (Level 3, 12-16 hours)
  - Analyze project structure for context-aware plan generation
  - Significant enhancement to plan quality and relevance
  - Advanced feature for future implementation

### Epic #28 Status

- **Phase 1**: âœ… GitHub Reader Step (Completed)
- **Phase 2**: âœ… Plan Generation Step (Completed)
- **Phase 3**: ðŸŽ¯ Plan Posting Step (Ready - Issue #96)
- **Phase 4**: ï¿½ï¿½ Context Enhancement (Future - Issue #97)

The foundation is complete and follow-up work is well-defined with comprehensive specifications.
