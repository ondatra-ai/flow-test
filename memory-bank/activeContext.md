# ACTIVE CONTEXT

## Current Task: flowmanager-converttoflow-private-20250123

**Issue**: #75 - Change FlowManager.convertToFlow method visibility from public to private
**Type**: Level 1 - Quick Bug Fix (Refactoring)
**Branch**: task-20250123-flowmanager-converttoflow-private

## Task Context

### Objective

Change the visibility of the `convertToFlow` method in the `FlowManager` class from `public` to `private` to improve encapsulation and API design.

### Technical Details

- **File**: `src/utils/flow-manager.ts`
- **Line**: 74
- **Current**: `public convertToFlow(flowData: unknown): Flow`
- **Target**: `private convertToFlow(flowData: unknown): Flow`

### Justification

- Method is only used internally within FlowManager class
- Called only from the `loadFlow()` method (line 51)
- No external dependencies on this method
- Improves encapsulation and follows principle of least privilege

### Impact Analysis

- ✅ **Safe to Change**: No external usage
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Internal method only
- ✅ **Consistent Pattern**: Aligns with other private methods in the class

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Code Change ✅

- Modify method visibility on line 74 of `src/utils/flow-manager.ts`

### Phase 2: Verification

- Compile TypeScript to check for errors
- Run test suite to ensure no regressions
- Review tests for direct usage of `convertToFlow`

### Phase 3: Testing

- Ensure test coverage through public `loadFlow` method
- Verify all existing tests pass

## Quality Checkpoints

- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] No external usage confirmed
