### Changes Made

1. **Schema Updated** ‚úÖ

   - TypeScript types automatically updated

2. **Implementation Updated** ‚úÖ
   - Removed conditional logic from `src/flow/types/read-github-issue-step.ts`
   - Comments are now always set in context via `context.set('github.issue.comments', JSON.stringify(comments))`

3. **Unit Tests Updated** ‚úÖ
   - Removed 3 `includeComments` references from `tests/unit/flow/types/read-github-issue-step.test.ts`
   - Removed 8 `includeComments` references from `tests/unit/flow/types/read-github-issue-step-execute.test.ts`
   - Deleted entire test case for `includeComments: false` behavior
   - Updated comment to reflect always storing comments

4. **Test Data Updated** ‚úÖ
   - Removed 6 `includeComments` references from `tests/unit/utils/test-data.json`
   - Removed `includeComments` from integration test flow configuration
   - Removed `includeComments` from `tests/integration/data/flow-execution/invalid-flow.json`
   - Removed `includeComments` from `tests/unit/utils/flow-manager.test.ts` (5 occurrences)
   - Removed `includeComments` from `tests/unit/flow/step-factory.test.ts` (2 occurrences)

5. **Verification Completed** ‚úÖ
   - All 179 tests passing
   - TypeScript compilation successful
   - ESLint passes with no errors
   - No `includeComments` references remain in source code
