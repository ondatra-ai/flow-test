## Current Task: Index.ts Logic Extraction for Testability

**Task ID**: index-logic-extraction-20250108  
**Date**: 2025-01-08  
**Complexity Level**: Level 1 (Quick Bug Fix/Improvement)  
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

### Task Overview

Extract business logic from the main function in src/index.ts to make it more testable and maintainable by separating CLI setup from business logic.

### GitHub Issue Reference

- **Issue #19**: https://github.com/ondatra-ai/flow-test/issues/19
- **Title**: Simplify index.ts: Extract logic from main function for testability
- **Labels**: enhancement
- **Status**: COMPLETED ✅

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Extract command logic into separate, testable functions
- [x] Separate CLI setup from business logic
- [x] Maintain current functionality
- [x] Add unit tests for extracted functions
- [x] Update existing tests to cover new structure

### Implementation Results

#### Phase 1: Analysis & Design ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Functions extracted and tested
- [x] File separation strategy designed

#### Phase 2: Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Created `src/cli/setup.ts` module for CLI configuration
- [x] Created `src/cli/handlers.ts` module for command handlers
- [x] Created `src/utils/test-generator.ts` module for test generation
- [x] Updated `src/index.ts` to contain only main function
- [x] All functions properly exported and imported

#### Phase 3: Testing & Validation ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Created `tests/unit/cli/setup.test.ts` for CLI setup tests
- [x] Created `tests/unit/cli/handlers.test.ts` for command handler tests
- [x] Created `tests/unit/utils/test-generator.test.ts` for test generator tests
- [x] Removed `tests/unit/index.test.ts` (no need to test main function)
- [x] Added `src/index.ts` to test coverage ignore list
- [x] All 121 tests passing
- [x] CLI functionality verified and working

#### Phase 4: Code Quality Improvements ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Updated `setupCliProgram` to accept program parameter
- [x] Updated `registerCommands` to accept program parameter
- [x] Improved dependency injection pattern
- [x] Updated tests to mock program parameter
- [x] Removed unnecessary main function testing

#### Phase 5: Reflection ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Implementation thoroughly reviewed
- [x] Successes and challenges documented
- [x] Lessons learned captured
- [x] Process improvements identified
- [x] Technical improvements documented
- [x] Reflection document created: `memory-bank/reflection/index-logic-extraction-reflection.md`

#### Phase 6: Archiving ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Archive document created with comprehensive details
- [x] All task documentation preserved
- [x] Memory Bank updated with references
- [x] Task marked as COMPLETED

### Status

- [x] Initialization complete
- [x] Planning complete
- [x] Implementation complete
- [x] Testing complete
- [x] Quality verification complete
- [x] Reflection complete
- [x] Archiving complete

### Success Criteria Status

- [x] Command logic extracted into separate, testable functions
- [x] CLI setup separated from business logic
- [x] Current functionality maintained
- [x] Unit tests added for extracted functions
- [x] Existing tests updated for new structure

### Quality Metrics Achieved

- **Functions Extracted**: 8 functions moved to appropriate modules
- **New Module Files**: 3 created
- **New Test Files**: 3 created
- **Test Coverage**: 121/121 tests passing (100%)
- **Code Lines in index.ts**: Reduced from 246 to 26 lines (89% reduction)
- **Functionality Changes**: 0 (pure refactoring)
- **Overall Coverage**: 95.73% maintained

### Files Modified

**New Module Files:**

- `src/cli/setup.ts` - CLI program setup and command registration
- `src/cli/handlers.ts` - Command handler functions
- `src/utils/test-generator.ts` - Test generation utilities

**Updated Files:**

- `src/index.ts` - Now contains only main function (26 lines vs 246 lines)
- `vitest.config.ts` - Added src/index.ts to coverage exclude list

**New Test Files:**

- `tests/unit/cli/setup.test.ts` - Tests for CLI setup module
- `tests/unit/cli/handlers.test.ts` - Tests for command handlers
- `tests/unit/utils/test-generator.test.ts` - Tests for test generator

**Removed Files:**

- `tests/unit/index.test.ts` - Removed as main function doesn't need testing

### Archive

- **Date**: 2025-01-08
- **Archive Document**: `memory-bank/archive/index-logic-extraction-archive-20250108.md`
- **Status**: COMPLETED ✅
