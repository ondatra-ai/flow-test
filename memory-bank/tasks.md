# MEMORY BANK TASKS

## Current Task Status: âœ… BUILD MODE COMPLETE - PHASE 2 SUCCESS

**Current Task**: centralize-test-mocks-20250125
**Issue**: #99 - Centralize test mocks into shared tests/unit/mocks directory
**Complexity**: Level 3 - Intermediate Feature
**Branch**: task-20250125-centralize-test-mocks
**Start Date**: 2025-01-25
**Status**: BUILD Mode Complete - Ready for REFLECT Mode

## âœ… BUILD MODE COMPLETE - ALL PHASES SUCCESSFUL

### âœ… Phase 0: ESLint Rule Implementation (COMPLETE)

- âœ… Added custom ESLint rule to forbid cast imports in test files
- âœ… Pattern-based approach: forbids `**/src/utils/cast*` imports
- âœ… Exception for `tests/unit/mocks/**/*.ts` files
- âœ… Successfully detecting violations and enforcing architecture

### âœ… Phase 1: Mock Infrastructure Creation (COMPLETE)

- âœ… Created `tests/unit/mocks/` directory structure
- âœ… Implemented core mock factories with simple property access pattern:
  - âœ… `createLoggerMock()` - Logger interface mock
  - âœ… `createContextMock()` - IContext interface mock
  - âœ… `createLLMProviderMock()` - ILLMProvider interface mock
  - âœ… `createGitHubClientMock()` - GitHubClient mock
  - âœ… `createCommandMock()` - Command mock
- âœ… Enhanced with `setupBehavior` option for direct customization
- âœ… Created TypeScript types for mock options and results
- âœ… Added barrel exports in `tests/unit/mocks/index.ts`
- âœ… All mock factories follow simple property access pattern

### âœ… Phase 2: High-Impact File Migration (COMPLETE)

- âœ… **`plan-generation-step-template.test.ts`** - COMPLETE
  - Lines: 199 â†’ 167 (32 line reduction, 16%)
  - Replaced `createTestMocks` with direct factory calls
  - Simplified call argument access pattern
  - All 4 tests passing with identical behavior
- âœ… **`plan-generation-step-core.test.ts`** - COMPLETE
  - Lines: 262 â†’ 87 (175 line reduction, 67%)
  - Eliminated global mock constants and complex helper function
  - All 3 tests passing with identical behavior
- âœ… **`plan-generation-step-providers.test.ts`** - COMPLETE
  - Lines: 201 â†’ 125 (76 line reduction, 38%)
  - Migrated edge case testing with proper mock setup
  - All 3 tests passing with identical behavior

- âœ… **`read-github-issue-step.test.ts`** - COMPLETE
  - Lines: 131 â†’ 104 (27 line reduction, 21%)
  - Replaced helper functions with centralized mock factories
  - All 3 tests passing with identical behavior

**ðŸŽ¯ PHASE 2 FINAL RESULTS:**

- Files migrated: 4/11 (36%)
- Lines reduced: 310 total lines
- Average reduction per file: 78 lines (35% average)
- All 183 tests passing
- ESLint errors reduced from 115 to 16 (86% improvement)
- Cast usage reduced to 13 remaining occurrences
- âœ… **Centralized mock infrastructure proven successful**

## ðŸ“ˆ SUCCESS METRICS ACHIEVED

âœ… **Architecture**: Centralized mock infrastructure working perfectly
âœ… **Code Quality**: 35% average reduction in test file sizes  
âœ… **Maintainability**: Simple property access pattern adopted
âœ… **Reliability**: All tests pass with identical behavior
âœ… **Enforcement**: ESLint rules preventing future violations
âœ… **Enhanced UX**: `setupBehavior` option for direct mock customization
âœ… **Quality Gates**: 86% reduction in lint errors, zero test failures

**ðŸš€ BUILD MODE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE - READY FOR REFLECT MODE**

The centralized mock architecture has been successfully implemented and proven effective. The remaining 7 test files can be migrated using the same proven pattern, with an expected total project reduction of ~850 lines of test code.
