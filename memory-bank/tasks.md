**Task ID**: refactor-test-mock-setup-20250121
**Start Date**: 2025-01-21
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-21
**Issue Reference**: Issue #95
**Branch**: task-20250121-refactor-test-mock-setup
**Complexity Level**: Level 1 - Quick Bug Fix
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - WITH FOLLOW-UP

## 📋 TASK OVERVIEW

**Primary Objective**: Refactor test mock setup duplication in plan-generation-step test files

**Task Description**: Extract duplicate mock setup code across multiple plan-generation-step test files to improve maintainability and follow DRY principle.

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Pre-Implementation Analysis - ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Review all plan-generation-step test files
- [x] Identify duplicated mock setup code patterns
- [x] Confirm scope extends beyond template file

### Implementation Steps - ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Refactor plan-generation-step-template.test.ts (original task)
- [x] Refactor plan-generation-step-core.test.ts (additional scope)
- [x] Verify plan-generation-step-providers.test.ts is clean
- [x] Verify all tests still pass

### Follow-up Actions - ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Create GitHub issue for broader mock centralization (#99)

## 🏗️ IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

### 1. **Template Test File** (plan-generation-step-template.test.ts):

- Created `createTestMocks()` function with optional behavior parameter
- Reduced from 246 to 193 lines (53 lines reduction)
- All 4 test methods now use shared helper

### 2. **Core Test File** (plan-generation-step-core.test.ts):

- Created `createFreshTestMocks()` function for isolated testing
- Eliminated inline mock duplication in one test method
- Better separation between shared and fresh mocks

### 3. **Providers Test File** (plan-generation-step-providers.test.ts):

- Already clean with module-level mocks
- Uses good pattern, no changes needed

## 🔄 FOLLOW-UP CREATED

**GitHub Issue #99**: [Centralize test mocks into shared tests/unit/mocks directory](https://github.com/ondatra-ai/flow-test/issues/99)

- **Type**: Level 3 - Intermediate Feature
- **Scope**: Project-wide mock centralization
- **Benefits**: Consistency, reusability, maintainability across all test files
- **Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS ACHIEVED

✅ **Code Quality**: Eliminated all mock duplication patterns in plan-generation-step tests
✅ **Test Coverage**: All 15 plan-generation-step tests passing
✅ **Maintainability**: Consistent mock creation patterns
✅ **Scope Expansion**: Fixed additional file beyond original scope
✅ **Strategic Planning**: Created follow-up issue for project-wide improvement
