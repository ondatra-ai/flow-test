**Issue Reference**: [#37](https://github.com/ondatra-ai/flow-test/issues/37)  
**Status**: COMPLETE âœ…

### TASK COMPLETED: Implement Step 1: Read task description from GitHub

**Objective**: Create a new step type that can read GitHub issue details (including comments) and make them available in validated flow context for the GitHub Task Automation Flow system.

**Complexity Level**: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 hours  
**Actual Effort**: ~6 hours (including major refactoring)  
**EPIC Context**: Part of EPIC #28 - GitHub Task Automation Flow

**TDD Approach**: Following RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle with failing e2e test first

## IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED âœ…

### ðŸ”´ RED Phase: COMPLETE âœ…

- [x] Created failing e2e test: `tests/integration/github-reader-tdd-e2e.test.ts`
