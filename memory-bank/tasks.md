**Task ID**: remove-duplicate-error-handling-20250123
**Issue**: #83 - Remove duplicate error handling in business logic
**Branch**: task-20250123-remove-duplicate-error-handling
**Complexity**: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement
**Started**: 2025-01-23

## Task Overview

### remove-duplicate-error-handling-20250123

**Issue Details**:

- **Issue #83**: Remove duplicate error handling in business logic
- **Type**: Code refactoring/cleanup to eliminate redundancy
- **Scope**: Multiple files across CLI handlers, flow session, and utilities
- **Impact**: Improved code maintainability and consistency

**Problem Description**:

- Duplicate error handling patterns where business logic components handle errors already caught at main level
- Creates unnecessary code duplication and inconsistent error handling patterns
- Type casting operations repeated for the same error objects

**Current State Analysis**:

- **Total `} catch (` occurrences in src/**: 14
- **Files affected**: 10 files
- **Main patterns identified**:
  1. Catch, log, and re-throw (most common)
  2. Catch, log, and throw new error with different message
  3. Catch and wrap/transform error (LLM providers - OK pattern)
  4. Catch and handle with recovery logic (github-client - OK pattern)

## Implementation Plan

### Contracts, scheme and interface updates

- No interface changes expected (error handling is implementation detail)
- No type changes expected
- No schema changes expected

### Functional changes

- **No functional tests expected to change** - Error handling refactoring should not affect functionality
- All existing tests should continue to pass
- Error messages should remain informative at the main handler level

### Technology Stack

- Framework: Node.js/TypeScript
- Build Tool: TypeScript Compiler
- Language: TypeScript
- Storage: N/A (refactoring only)

### Technology Validation Checkpoints

- [x] Project initialization command verified (existing project)
- [x] Required dependencies identified and installed (no new dependencies)
- [x] Build configuration validated (no changes needed)
- [x] Hello world verification completed (existing functionality)
- [x] Test build passes successfully (188/188 tests passing)

### Files to Modify

#### Remove duplicate error handling (catch and re-throw pattern):

1. `src/cli/handlers.ts` - 2 occurrences
   - Line 23: handleGitHubIssueOption - catches and re-throws
   - Line 98: (need to check second occurrence)

2. `src/flow/session/session.ts` - 1 occurrence
   - Line 51: (need to check pattern)

3. `src/flow/types/plan-generation-step.ts` - 1 occurrence
   - Line 57: (need to check pattern)

4. `src/flow/types/read-github-issue-step.ts` - 1 occurrence
   - Line 77: (need to check pattern)

5. `src/utils/flow-manager.ts` - 3 occurrences
   - Line 39: Catches, logs, throws new error
   - Line 55: (need to check pattern)
   - Line 81: (need to check pattern)

6. `src/utils/cast.ts` - 1 occurrence
   - Line 46: (need to check pattern)

#### Keep proper error handling (these are OK):

- `src/utils/github-client.ts` - Has error recovery logic
- `src/providers/llm/providers/*.ts` - Error wrapping for streaming

### Implementation Steps

1. **Audit Phase**
   - [x] Search for all `} catch (` patterns in src/
   - [ ] Review each catch block to determine if it's duplicate handling
   - [ ] Document which patterns to remove vs. keep

2. **Refactoring Phase**
   - [ ] Remove catch blocks that only log and re-throw in `src/cli/handlers.ts`
   - [ ] Remove catch blocks that only log and re-throw in `src/flow/session/session.ts`
   - [ ] Remove catch blocks that only log and re-throw in `src/flow/types/*.ts`
   - [ ] Simplify error handling in `src/utils/flow-manager.ts`
   - [ ] Review and update `src/utils/cast.ts` error handling

3. **Error Context Preservation**
   - [ ] Ensure error messages provide enough context without intermediate logging
   - [ ] Consider enriching errors with context before they bubble up
   - [ ] Verify main error handler receives sufficient information

4. **Testing Phase**
   - [ ] Run all unit tests after each file modification
   - [ ] Run integration tests to verify error propagation
   - [ ] Test error scenarios manually to ensure messages are informative

5. **Verification Phase**
   - [ ] Count `} catch (` occurrences - should be minimal
   - [ ] Verify all tests still pass (188/188)
   - [ ] Check that error messages at main level are still helpful

## Success Criteria

- [x] Current `} catch (` count in src/\*\*: 14 occurrences
- [ ] Target `} catch (` count in src/\*\*: â‰¤ 5 occurrences (only necessary handlers)
- [ ] All business logic components let errors bubble up naturally
- [ ] Main error handler catches and processes all application errors
- [ ] Error messages remain informative and actionable
- [ ] No functionality is lost during error handling refactoring
- [ ] Consistent error handling patterns across the codebase
- [ ] All tests continue to pass (188/188)

## Challenges & Mitigations

1. **Challenge**: Preserving error context when removing intermediate handlers
   - **Mitigation**: Enrich errors with context before they bubble up using error cause or custom properties

2. **Challenge**: Ensuring error messages remain informative
   - **Mitigation**: Test each change to verify error output at main level

3. **Challenge**: Identifying which error handlers are truly necessary
   - **Mitigation**: Keep handlers that transform errors or implement recovery logic

## Dependencies

- None - this is a refactoring task with no new dependencies

## Creative Phases Required

- None - this is a straightforward refactoring task
