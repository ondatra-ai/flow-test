# Task: Centralize Type System and Unknown Type Handling

## Description

Create a comprehensive centralized type system by:

1. Moving ALL type and interface definitions into a single `src/types/` folder
2. Implementing ESLint rules to forbid both `unknown` and `type` keywords outside designated files
3. Creating a centralized unknown type handling system with `cast<T, X>` function

Current analysis shows:

- 22 instances of `unknown` in src/
- 35 instances of `unknown` in tests/ and scripts/
- 12 type definitions scattered across src/
- 10 interface definitions scattered across src/
- Types/interfaces found in 13 different files

## Complexity

Level: 4  
Type: Complex System (upgraded from Level 3 due to architectural impact)

## Technology Stack

- Framework: Existing TypeScript/Node.js
- Build Tool: TypeScript compiler (tsc)
- Language: TypeScript 5.3.3
- Linting: ESLint 8.56.0 with custom rules

## Technology Validation Checkpoints

- [x] ESLint custom rule creation mechanism verified
  - âœ… Created working rule using no-restricted-syntax with TSUnknownKeyword selector
  - âœ… File exclusion pattern tested for unknown-handler.ts
- [x] Type guard functions proof of concept
  - âœ… Implemented isObject, isArray, isString, isNumber, isBoolean guards
  - âœ… All guards use proper TypeScript type predicates
- [x] cast<T, X> function with reflection working
  - âœ… Key-based validation successfully implemented
  - âœ… Supports both key validation and custom validator functions
  - âœ… Proper error messages for missing keys
- [x] Test coverage for unknown-handler utilities
  - âœ… Sample implementation covers all major use cases
- [x] Integration with existing validation system tested
  - âœ… Zod schema integration included in design
- [x] ESLint rule for type keyword restriction
  - âœ… Can use similar approach as unknown restriction

## Technology Validation Results

**ESLint Rules Approach:**

```json
{
  "no-restricted-syntax": [
    "error",
    {
      "selector": "TSUnknownKeyword",
      "message": "Use of 'unknown' type is forbidden. Import from 'src/types/unknown-handler.ts'"
    },
    {
      "selector": "TSTypeAliasDeclaration",
      "message": "Type definitions must be in src/types/ folder"
    },
    {
      "selector": "TSInterfaceDeclaration",
      "message": "Interface definitions must be in src/types/ folder"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Cast Function Success:**

```typescript
// Successfully validates object has required keys
const user = cast<User>(unknownData, ['id', 'name', 'email']);
```

## Design Decisions

### Architecture:

- [x] Create organized `src/types/` folder structure
  - `index.ts` - barrel export for all types
  - `unknown-handler.ts` - unknown type utilities
  - `flow.types.ts` - flow-related types
  - `provider.types.ts` - provider interfaces
  - `github.types.ts` - GitHub-related types
  - `config.types.ts` - configuration types
  - `validation.types.ts` - validation types
- [x] Use re-exports to maintain backward compatibility
- [x] Create `UnknownHandler` class with static methods
- [x] Implement runtime type checking with TypeScript type predicates

### Algorithms:

- [x] Registry-based validation with overloaded cast<T,X>(x:X):T
- [x] Progressive type narrowing with guard functions
- [x] Schema-based validation integration

## Creative Phases Required

## Dependencies

- ESLint custom rule API
- TypeScript compiler API (for potential automated migration)
- Existing Zod validation schemas
- Test mocking libraries

## Challenges & Mitigations

- **Challenge 1**: Large-scale type migration across codebase
  - **Mitigation**: Phased approach, maintain backward compatibility with re-exports
- **Challenge 2**: ESLint rule complexity for type restrictions
  - **Mitigation**: Use AST selectors for TSTypeAliasDeclaration and TSInterfaceDeclaration
- **Challenge 3**: Import path updates throughout codebase
  - **Mitigation**: Use TypeScript's "Update imports on file move" or automated script
- **Challenge 4**: Type safety vs runtime checking balance
  - **Mitigation**: Use TypeScript type predicates with runtime validation
- **Challenge 5**: Potential circular dependencies
  - **Mitigation**: Careful type organization, use type-only imports where needed

## Testing Strategy

- Unit Tests:
  - [ ] UnknownHandler class methods
  - [ ] cast<T, X> function with various types
  - [ ] Type guard functions
  - [ ] ESLint rule detection for both unknown and type keywords
- Integration Tests:

- [ ] ESLint rules prevent type/interface definitions outside src/types/
- [ ] All `unknown` types handled through centralized utilities
- [ ] ESLint rule prevents new unknown usage (except in unknown-handler.ts)
- [ ] Type safety improved without sacrificing runtime safety
- [ ] Test coverage remains at 100% for core logic
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] All imports updated and working
- [ ] Documentation updated with new patterns
