# Task Archive: Dynamic Step Execution with Context Mapping

## Metadata

- **Complexity**: Level 2 (Simple Enhancement)
- **Type**: Flow System Enhancement
- **Date Completed**: 2025-07-10
- **Task ID**: dynamic-step-execution-20250710
- **GitHub Issue**: #31 - https://github.com/ondatra-ai/flow-test/issues/31
- **Parent Epic**: EPIC #28 - GitHub Task Automation Flow
- **Related Tasks**: Foundational requirement for automated GitHub task resolution system

## Summary

Successfully implemented dynamic step execution with context mapping for the Flow system, transforming the static step navigation model into a context-driven runtime execution system. This enhancement enables flows to make runtime decisions about execution paths based on context values, serving as a critical building block for the automated GitHub task resolution system. The implementation achieved 100% success rate with all 147 tests passing, zero TypeScript/ESLint errors, and comprehensive end-to-end functionality verification.

## Requirements

- Transform static step execution (`Promise<boolean>`) to dynamic execution (`Promise<string | null>`)
- Enable context-based routing where steps return next step ID based on context values
- Support object mapping format for `nextStepId` with key-value routing
- Implement default fallback mechanism for undefined context keys
- Use empty object `{}` to indicate flow completion (end step)
- Remove static `getNext()` method from step interface
- Update flow execution to use step return values for navigation
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage and quality standards

## Implementation

### Approach

Implemented a clean architectural transformation using simplified design decisions:

- **Single Type Strategy**: Used `Record<string, string>` only (no union types) for cleaner code
- **Breaking Change Acceptance**: Removed backward compatibility to achieve simpler, more maintainable design
- **Context Integration**: Properly integrated context parameter usage for routing decisions
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added 5 new tests while updating all existing tests

### Key Components

- **IStep Interface**: Updated `execute()` method to return `Promise<string | null>` instead of `Promise<boolean>`
- **Step Implementation**: Added dynamic routing logic with context-based path selection
- **Flow System**: Removed static navigation methods and integrated step return value navigation
- **Flow Manager**: Updated validation to support object format with comprehensive error handling
- **Test Migration**: Successfully updated all existing tests and added comprehensive new test coverage

### Files Changed

- `src/flow/step.ts`: Updated interface and implementation for dynamic routing
- `src/flow/flow.ts`: Removed static navigation methods (`getNextStepId()`)
- `src/flow/session/session.ts`: Updated to use step return values for navigation
- `src/utils/flow-manager.ts`: Updated validation for object format, comprehensive error handling
- `tests/unit/flow/step.test.ts`: Updated for new return type and dynamic routing
- `tests/unit/flow/flow.test.ts`: Updated for removed static navigation methods
- `tests/unit/flow/session/session.test.ts`: Updated for new navigation pattern
- `tests/unit/utils/flow-manager.test.ts`: Added object format validation tests
- `.flows/test-flow.json`: Migrated to new object format
- `.flows/dynamic-test-flow.json`: Created for dynamic routing testing

## Testing

- **Test Count**: 147 tests passing (up from 142 baseline)
- **TypeScript Compilation**: 0 errors (strict mode)
- **ESLint**: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- **Code Coverage**: Maintained above 80% threshold
- **End-to-End Testing**: CLI functionality verified for both basic and dynamic routing
- **Migration Testing**: Verified old format rejection and new format acceptance
- **Dynamic Routing Testing**: Confirmed context-based path selection works correctly
- **Error Handling Testing**: Validated comprehensive error handling for invalid references

## Lessons Learned

- **Interface Design Impact**: Return type changes at interface level cascade through entire system - careful planning of change sequence prevents compilation issues
- **Context Parameter Integration**: Removing underscore prefix from `_context` to `context` was crucial for proper context-driven routing functionality
- **Breaking Change Strategy**: Accepting breaking changes early in design phase led to cleaner, more maintainable code
- **Systematic Testing Approach**: Writing tests for new functionality before removing old functionality prevented regression issues
- **End-to-End Testing Value**: Manual CLI testing caught integration issues that unit tests missed, particularly around flow migration and context handling

## Future Considerations

- **Dynamic Routing Patterns**: Establish patterns for common routing scenarios (task type evaluation, error handling paths) to guide future flow implementations
- **Context Testing Utilities**: Develop test utilities specifically for context-based routing scenarios to simplify future testing
- **Migration Documentation**: Create comprehensive migration documentation for future breaking changes to Flow system
- **Advanced Context Features**: Consider implementing context validation, type safety, and complex routing logic for future enhancements
