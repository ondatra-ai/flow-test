# TASK ARCHIVE: Centralize Test Mocks into Shared Directory

**Feature ID**: centralize-test-mocks-20250125  
**Date Archived**: 2025-01-25  
**Task Type**: Level 3 - Intermediate Feature (Testing Infrastructure)  
**GitHub Issue**: #99 - https://github.com/ondrata-ai/flow-test/issues/99  
**Status**: COMPLETED & ARCHIVED ✅

## 1. Feature Overview

Successfully implemented a centralized mock management system that eliminated code duplication across test files and resolved critical CI/CD pipeline blockers. This Level 3 intermediate feature transformed the testing infrastructure by creating a unified mock system with factory patterns, TypeScript safety, and ESLint enforcement.

**Purpose**: Eliminate mock code duplication, establish consistent patterns, resolve pipeline violations, and enhance developer experience with reusable mock infrastructure.

**Original Task Reference**: See `memory-bank/tasks.md` - centralize-test-mocks-20250125 section

## 2. Key Requirements Met

✅ **Primary Functional Requirements**:

- Create centralized `tests/unit/mocks/` directory structure
- Implement mock factories for all core interfaces (Logger, Context, LLMProvider, GitHubClient, Command)
- Migrate all 11 test files to use centralized mocks
- Establish TypeScript-safe mock patterns without compromising type safety
- Eliminate code duplication across test files

✅ **Quality Requirements**:

- Maintain 100% test success rate throughout migration (183+ tests)
- Achieve zero breaking changes during refactoring
- Resolve all critical `no-restricted-imports` ESLint violations (11 → 0)
- Ensure TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Maintain pipeline integration capabilities

✅ **Architecture Requirements**:

- Implement factory pattern for type-safe mock creation
- Create ESLint rules to prevent future violations
- Establish consistent mock behavior patterns
- Enable enhanced developer experience with customization options

## 3. Design Decisions & Creative Outputs

**Key Architectural Decisions**:

### Factory Pattern Selection

- **Decision**: Use factory functions over class-based mock creation
- **Rationale**: Provides better TypeScript integration and simpler usage patterns
- **Implementation**: `createLoggerMock()`, `createContextMock()`, etc.

### setupBehavior Enhancement

- **Decision**: Add optional `setupBehavior` parameter for direct mock customization
- **Rationale**: Enhances developer experience beyond original requirements
- **Implementation**: Allows direct property access and customization during mock creation

### ESLint Rule Strategy

- **Decision**: Use `no-restricted-imports` instead of custom ESLint rule
- **Rationale**: Simpler implementation, more reliable enforcement
- **Implementation**: Forbid `**/src/utils/cast*` imports in test files with exception for mock directory

### Directory Structure

- **Decision**: Organized structure with barrel exports
- **Rationale**: Clean imports and logical organization
- **Implementation**:
  ```
  tests/unit/mocks/
  ├── cli/command-mock.ts
  ├── flow/context-mock.ts
  ├── providers/llm-provider-mock.ts
  ├── utils/github-client-mock.ts, logger-mock.ts
  ├── types.ts
  └── index.ts (barrel exports)
  ```

**No Traditional Creative Phase**: This was an infrastructure task, but significant design decisions were documented throughout implementation.

## 4. Implementation Summary

### High-Level Approach

Systematic 5-phase implementation that prevented complexity overwhelm and enabled continuous verification:

**Phase 0: ESLint Rule Implementation** (1-2 hours)

- Added `no-restricted-imports` rule to forbid cast usage in test files
- Identified 11 existing violations across codebase
- Prevented new violations during migration

**Phase 1: Mock Infrastructure Creation** (2-3 hours)

- Created `tests/unit/mocks/` directory structure
- Implemented 5 core mock factories with TypeScript safety
- Added `setupBehavior` enhancement for customization
- Created barrel exports for clean imports

**Phase 2: High-Impact File Migration** (2-3 hours)

- Migrated plan-generation-step test files (highest duplication impact)
- Achieved significant line reductions: 199→167 (-16%), 262→87 (-67%), 201→125 (-38%)
- Validated approach with complex test scenarios

**Phase 3: Complete Migration** (3-4 hours)

- Migrated remaining 7 test files to centralized mocks
- Eliminated all 11 `no-restricted-imports` violations
- Maintained 100% test success rate throughout

**Phase 4: PR Integration** (Additional)

- Resolved 5/5 PR conversations constructively
- Enhanced logger mock implementation based on feedback
- Improved consistency patterns across all mocks

### Primary Components Created

**Mock Factories**:

- `createLoggerMock()` - Console-based logger with message capture
- `createContextMock()` - String-string context interface
- `createLLMProviderMock()` - Streaming LLM provider with async generator support
- `createGitHubClientMock()` - GitHub API client with repository operations
- `createCommandMock()` - CLI command interface for testing

**ESLint Configuration**:

- `no-restricted-imports` rule targeting cast utility imports
- Exception pattern for `tests/unit/mocks/**/*.ts` files
- Automated violation detection and prevention

**TypeScript Types**:

- `MockOptions` interfaces for each factory
- `MockResult` types for factory return values
- Type-safe `setupBehavior` function signatures

### Key Technologies Utilized

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode compliance with full type safety
- **ESLint**: `no-restricted-imports` rule for architectural enforcement
- **Vitest**: Testing framework integration
- **Factory Pattern**: Type-safe mock creation and customization

### Code Repository

- **Branch**: `task-20250125-centralize-test-mocks`
- **Files Modified**: 23 total files (11 test files + 12 infrastructure files)
- **Lines Changed**: 850+ lines eliminated, enhanced functionality added

## 5. Testing Overview

### Testing Strategy

**Continuous Verification Approach**: Testing performed after each implementation phase to prevent regression and ensure quality.

**Test Coverage**:

- **Unit Tests**: All 183+ tests maintained throughout migration
- **Integration Tests**: Mock factories tested with real test scenarios
- **End-to-End Validation**: Complete system testing confirmed zero breaking changes
- **Pipeline Integration**: CI/CD validation with ESLint and TypeScript compilation

### Testing Results

✅ **Perfect Success Rate**: 183+ tests passing consistently  
✅ **Zero Regression**: All existing test behavior preserved  
✅ **Quality Gates Passed**: 0 TypeScript errors, 0 ESLint violations  
✅ **Pipeline Success**: CI/CD unblocked with resolved violations
