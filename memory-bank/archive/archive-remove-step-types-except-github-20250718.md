```

### Core Files Updated

```
src/flow/types/index.ts - Updated exports
src/flow/step-factory.ts - Simplified to ReadGitHubIssueStep only
src/validation/schemas/step.schema.ts - Removed unused schemas
src/types/validation/schemas.types.ts - Removed type definitions
src/types/validation/index.ts - Updated type exports

```

### Test System Improvements

- Updated FlowManager directory structure for correct path handling
- Enhanced integration tests with real GitHub API data verification
- Improved error handling for external API dependencies
- Added comprehensive environment variable loading

## Challenges Resolved

### 1. **Directory Structure Misconfiguration**

- **Issue**: FlowManager was looking for flows in `.flows/flows/` instead of `.flows/`
- **Resolution**: Reverted to correct path structure and updated test utilities
- **Impact**: Prevented runtime configuration errors and improved reliability

### 2. **Test Environment Setup**

- **Issue**: GitHub API integration tests lacked proper authentication
- **Resolution**: Added dotenv package loading in both src/index.ts and test setup
- **Impact**: Enabled real GitHub API testing with proper credentials

### 3. **Integration Test Quality**

- **Issue**: Tests only verified execution success, not actual content correctness
- **Resolution**: Enhanced tests to verify real GitHub issue data (title, author, body, comments)
- **Impact**: Increased confidence in GitHub integration functionality

### 4. **API Rate Limiting**

- **Issue**: GitHub API rate limiting could cause test failures
- **Resolution**: Implemented proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Impact**: More robust test execution in CI/CD environments

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript Errors**: 0
- **ESLint Violations**: 0
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained high coverage standards
- **Build Status**: SUCCESS

### Implementation Metrics

- **Time Taken**: ~2 hours (vs estimated 75 minutes)
