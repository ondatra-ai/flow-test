# TASK ARCHIVE: Node.js 22 Upgrade

## Metadata

- **Task ID**: nodejs-22-upgrade-20250706
- **Complexity**: Level 1 (Quick Bug Fix)
- **Type**: Version Upgrade
- **Date Completed**: 2025-01-06
- **Duration**: Quick verification task
- **Status**: COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully completed Level 1 task to upgrade Node.js references to version 22 across the project. Upon investigation, discovered that the project was already at the target state, making this a verification and quality assurance establishment task rather than an implementation task.

## Requirements

- Upgrade all Node.js references from version 18+ to version 22+
- Ensure consistency across all documentation
- Verify package.json dependencies are compatible with Node.js 22
- Establish comprehensive quality assurance standards

## Implementation

### Approach

Conducted systematic verification of all files containing Node.js version references to determine current state and required changes.

### Key Findings

- **README.md**: Already specified "Node.js 22+" - no change needed
- **package.json**: Already specified "@types/node": "^22.0.0" and engines ">=22.0.0" - no change needed
- **doc/installation.md**: Already mentioned "Version 22 or higher" - no change needed

### Files Analyzed

- `README.md`: ✅ Already at target state
- `package.json`: ✅ Already at target state
- `doc/installation.md`: ✅ Already at target state

### Quality Assurance Standards Established

- `npm run test`: 30/30 tests must pass
- `npm run lint`: No linting errors allowed
- `npm run type-check`: No TypeScript compilation errors
- `npm run format:check`: All files must be properly formatted

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: ✅ 30/30 tests passed
- **Linting**: ✅ No errors found
- **Type Checking**: ✅ No TypeScript errors
- **Code Formatting**: ✅ All files properly formatted
- **Documentation Consistency**: ✅ All files consistent

## Lessons Learned

- **Pre-task verification is crucial**: Always verify current state before implementing changes
- **QA standards establishment**: Comprehensive quality assurance checks prevent issues
- **Documentation consistency**: Ensuring alignment across all project documentation is valuable
- **Efficient task completion**: Proper assessment can lead to quick task resolution

## Process Improvements Identified

- **Pre-task verification checklist**: Implement systematic review of current state
- **QA integration**: Apply established quality assurance process to all future tasks
- **Memory Bank optimization**: Task tracking and documentation approach proved effective

## Technical Improvements

- **Automated validation**: npm script-based QA checks provide reliable validation
- **Consistent tooling**: Standard tools across project ensure reliability
- **Version consistency**: Systematic approach to version management across documentation

## Future Considerations

- Consider automating current state verification for similar upgrade tasks
- Apply established QA standards as template for all future tasks
- Use this verification approach for other dependency upgrades
