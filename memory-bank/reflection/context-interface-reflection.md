## Challenges Encountered

### Technical Challenges

1. **Type System Evolution**
   - Started with `unknown` types, refactored to string-string
   - Required updating interface, implementation, and all tests
   - TypeScript compilation errors during transition

2. **Code Quality Issues**
   - ESLint import ordering required multiple fix iterations
   - Test function length exceeded 50-line limit
   - Unused parameter warnings in interface implementations

3. **Integration Complexity**
   - Parameter addition affected multiple files simultaneously
   - Required coordinated updates to Step, Flow, Session, and all tests
   - Backward compatibility verification across test suite

### Process Challenges

1. **Scope Refinement**
   - Mid-implementation change from mixed types to string-only
   - Required rethinking test scenarios and examples
   - Documentation updates to reflect new approach

2. **Quality Iteration**
   - Multiple linting rounds for import order and formatting
   - Test refactoring for function length compliance
   - Coverage verification and documentation

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **Start with Concrete Types**
   - Begin with specific types (string-string) rather than generic (unknown)
   - Concrete types provide clearer implementation guidance
   - Reduces refactoring and type-related errors

2. **Interface-First Design**
   - Define interfaces before implementation for cleaner integration
   - Interface contracts clarify expectations for all stakeholders
   - Enables parallel development of dependent components

3. **Context Pattern Validation**
   - String-string storage is sufficient for flow data sharing
   - Map-based implementation provides excellent performance
   - External getContext() access enables flexible usage patterns

4. **Import Organization**
   - Group imports by source: external → internal → relative
   - Consistent ordering prevents ESLint issues
   - Apply formatting standards from the start

### Architecture Insights

1. **Backward Compatibility Strategy**
   - Adding parameters to existing interfaces requires updating all implementations
   - Test-first approach helps identify all affected components
   - Systematic updates prevent missed integration points

2. **Test Organization Best Practices**
   - Group related tests in describe blocks for maintainability
   - Keep individual test functions under 50 lines
   - Balance comprehensive coverage with readable test structure

3. **Level 2 Task Characteristics**
   - Simple enhancements involve interface additions with system integration
   - Scope is well-defined but requires careful implementation planning
   - Quality standards remain rigorous regardless of complexity level

### Process Insights

1. **Quality-First Development**
   - Run incremental QA checks during implementation
   - Address linting issues immediately rather than batching
   - Coverage verification should be built into the workflow

2. **Documentation Integration**
   - Update system patterns during implementation, not after
   - Real-time documentation prevents knowledge loss
   - Standards updates improve future task execution

## Process & Technical Improvements

### Process Enhancements

1. **Pre-Implementation Type Definition**
   - Define exact types and interfaces before coding begins
   - Create type specification as first implementation step
